# Covid-19-Data-Visualization
A visualization of COVID-19 data

## Data
This datasets contain COVID-19 statistics from more than 3000 counties across all states in
the US. The stats include number of deaths, cases, and mask wearing frquency. The data was
forked from this datasets https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data, about 2 weeks before this
repository

## Prototypes

Below is an example demonstation of what the data looks like. This a bar chart contains number
of confirmed deaths in the first 10 counties that appear in the datasets.

## Questions and Tasks

- Correlation between mask wearing frequency and number of cases in counties
- Correlation between mask wearing frequency and number of cases in states
- Difference betwwen cases in different regions of the US (west and east coast, northern and southern US)

## Open Question
This visualization project is challenging because I don't know how I could design an interactive map of the US.
For example, I don't know how to make it possible to click on a states, and the screen would show a bunch of
stats for that states (example in the sketch).
