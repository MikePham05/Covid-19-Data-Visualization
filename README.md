# Covid-19-Data-Visualization
A visualization of COVID-19 cases distribution data in the US

## Data
This datasets contain COVID-19 statistics from more than 3000 counties across all states in
the US. The stats include number of deaths, cases, and mask wearing frquency. The data was
forked from this datasets https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data, about 2 weeks before this
repository

## Prototypes

Below is an example demonstation of what the data looks like. This a bar chart contains number
of confirmed deaths in the first 10 counties that appear in the datasets.

## Questions and Tasks

- Correlation between mask wearing frequency and number of cases in counties
- Correlation between mask wearing frequency and number of cases in states
- Difference betwwen cases in different regions of the US (west and east coast, northern and southern US)

## Open Question
This visualization project is challenging because I don't know how I could design an interactive map of the US.
For example, I don't know how to make it possible to click on a states, and the screen would show a bunch of
stats for that states (example in the sketch).

## Progress 1

At this point of the project, I have completed my 1st and 2nd mile stones, which precisely includes these tasks:
  - Research d3 function to render geolocation
  - Successfully render the US map
  - Load data 
  - Name display (Not abbreviation)

## Progress 2

At this point of the project, I have updated interactions and visual cues:
  - Names are now abbreviation
  - The states now has color that reflects number of cases in each states in the US
  - Color legend added
  - The states when clicked on now display related stats, and the number is also reflected on the color legend down below
  - Final polish (reformatting number, text size, color scheme)
